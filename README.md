##### Objectives
- To maintain basic coding principles and devolop sound skills in python programming.
- See if ROSALIND has any new material that will help me expand my knowlege in bioinformatic analysis techniques

****Created a repository synced with Git that updates directly from my computer, so I'm archiving this repository in favor of the that version. See Rosalind Problems Synced.
