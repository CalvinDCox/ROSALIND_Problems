#Given: A DNA string ss of length at most 1000 bp.
#Return: Four integers (separated by spaces) representing the respective number of times that the symbols 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' occur in ss. Note: You must provide your answer in the format shown in the sample output below.

#Initializing BioPython, a tool recommended for use with this problem
from Bio.Seq import Seq

#Open file and read the first line
file = open('exampletext.txt')
sequence = file.readline()

#This step, as I understand it, quantifies all the A, C, T's and G's as numbers, which I store in the simply named variables below
counts = Seq(sequence)

A = counts.count("A")
C = counts.count("C")
T = counts.count("T")
G = counts.count("G")

#Print out output in the all important manditory format
print(str(A) + " " + str(C) + " " + str(G) + " " + str(T))
